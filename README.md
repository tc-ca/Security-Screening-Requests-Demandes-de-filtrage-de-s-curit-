2. Use the excel files found in ```./data``` to import the requried translation data into the soltuion's data tables
3. Upload the provided ```Applications_Static.xlsx``` file to your desired SharePoint Site. This is the excel file where new requests will be visible (in addition to the underlying databse)
4. Update the cloud flow ```Dataverse -> Excel``` found in the cloud flows tab of your solution.
